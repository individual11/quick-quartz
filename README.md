# Quick Quartz
Inspired by [QuartzComposer.tv](http://quartzcomposer.tv/), I put together this repo to show small examples of using [Origami](http://facebook.github.io/origami/) as I learn myself. I'm sure not everything I show will be the best way to do that, so please fork the repo and pull request updates showing it the right way.

I'm also doing videos of each project, which you can see [here](individual11.github.io/quick-quartz).

## Requirments
Before you start building any of these, you will need:

* [Quartz Composer](http://developer.apple.com/downloads)
* [Origami](http://facebook.github.io/origami/)
